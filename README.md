# Forecasting-of-Smart-city-traffic-patterns
•	Smart cities are rapidly emerging as the future of urban development, incorporating advanced technologies to enhance the quality of life for residents. One critical aspect of smart cities is efficient traffic management, as urban areas face increasing challenges related to congestion, pollution, and time wasted in traffic. To address these issues, accurate forecasting of smart city traffic patterns has become a crucial area of research and development.
•	The forecasting of smart city traffic patterns involves predicting the flow of vehicles, identifying congestion-prone areas, and anticipating future traffic demands. By leveraging data from various sources such as sensors, GPS devices, traffic cameras, and social media platforms, cities can gain valuable insights into traffic patterns, enabling them to make informed decisions for effective traffic management and optimization.
•	The importance of accurate traffic pattern forecasting cannot be overstated. It allows city authorities to proactively allocate resources, optimize traffic signal timings, implement dynamic routing strategies, and improve transportation infrastructure planning. Additionally, accurate predictions can assist commuters in making informed decisions regarding travel routes and modes of transportation, thereby reducing travel time, fuel consumption, and environmental impact.
•	The objective of this project report is to explore and analyze different methods, techniques, and models for forecasting smart city traffic patterns. By investigating the existing research in this field and conducting experiments using real-world traffic data, we aim to contribute to the advancement of traffic forecasting capabilities and provide valuable insights for smart city planners, traffic engineers, and policymakers.
